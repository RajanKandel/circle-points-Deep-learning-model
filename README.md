# practice on deep learning model

workflow for running this code:
1) run datageneration.ipynb(this is for data generation, since the data is already generated and is in the file itself. This step is not necessary to run) 
2) run datapreprocessing.ipynb
3) run traininglinearregressionmodel.ipynb (this code generates the linear model parameters for linear regression model)
